* Boxes and Beams Initial Sketch
** DONE Set up 3D grid and camera
CLOSED: [2019-02-20 Wed 21:49]

** TODO Create ExtendableBox node
*** DONE Create a new ofNode (inherit from ofBox?)
CLOSED: [2019-02-21 Thu 21:57]
*** DONE Add anchor points on each face of the box
CLOSED: [2019-02-21 Thu 23:35]

*** DONE Add method to expand a certain number of units along one axis
CLOSED: [2019-03-04 Mon 16:53]
*** DONE Use linear interpolation with the box's scale to reach the target size
CLOSED: [2019-03-04 Mon 16:53]


*** TODO Implement method to separate the expanded box into multiple extendable boxes
**** DONE Create an ExtendableBoxPool
CLOSED: [2019-03-05 Tue 20:31]
**** TODO Write the subdivision algorithm
***** TODO Grab n - 1 boxes from the pool, add geom to vector with original box
***** TODO Determine the position and scale of each new box
Let x be the scaling axis
Let S_x be the scale the box being subdivided
Let s_x be the scale of each new box
[s_x / 2 - p_x - s_x / 2][s_x / 2 - p_x - s_x / 2]
[        S_x / 2      P_x       S_x / 2      ]

Let n be the number of subdivisions
s_x = S_x / n

p_c = P_x - S_x / 2 + s_x / 2
for b_i with i from 0 to n
  b_i -> s_x = s_x
  b_i -> p_x = p_c
  p_c += s_x
  
*** TODO Add ColorGenerator
**** TODO Create a color generator that cycles through different colors based on color theory
**** TODO Pass color generator into initial box to pass down to children


** TODO Write the control behavior 
*** TODO Idea 1: go from a point, to a plane, to a cube, and then collapse the cube into a different plane
*** TODO Idea 2: Create a tree like fractal that goes up and then out in all directions. Rotate each subtree at different speeds?
*** TODO Idea 3: Particles shoot at the grid, destroy sections which are then regenerated
** TODO Add some decoration 
*** TODO Particle trails from moving boxes?
*** TODO Color flowing through the beams
*** TODO Cutting out shapes in the boxes and beams
