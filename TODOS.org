** TODO Create ExtendableBox node
*** DONE Create a new ofNode (inherit from ofBox?)
CLOSED: [2019-02-21 Thu 21:57]
*** DONE Add anchor points on each face of the box

*** TODO Implement method to separate the expanded box into multiple extendable boxes
**** TODO Create an ExtendableBoxPool
***** TODO Create a unordered set to hold the extendable boxes in the pool
***** TODO Initialize with a certain number of boxes in the set
***** TODO Add a create method that returns a 
***** TODO Learn how to make the Pool generic
**** TODO Move and scale the original box on one side, create new boxes and move and scale them to each subdivision
**** TODO Create a relatively smaller box in between each pair of larger boxes with no width. Parent a larger box to each end on the scaling axis
**** TODO Recursively call the extend and split method on the new boxes
**** TODO When the box has been alive for a certain amount of time, return it to the pool

** TODO Write the control behavior 
*** TODO Idea 1: go from a point, to a plane, to a cube, and then collapse the cube into a different plane
*** TODO Idea 2: Create a tree like fractal that goes up and then out in all directions. Rotate each subtree at different speeds?
*** TODO Idea 3: Particles shoot at the grid, destroy sections which are then regenerated
** TODO Add some decoration 
*** TODO Particle trails from moving boxes?
*** TODO Color flowing through the beams
*** TODO Cutting out shapes in the boxes and beams
